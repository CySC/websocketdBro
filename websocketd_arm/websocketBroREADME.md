Use in WebsockedBro
==========
For the sake of simplicity an executable(precompiled for arm architecure) for websocketd was added in this directory
so that developers can just clone the project and get started and so that every developer is using the same version of
websocketd.
Feel free to download later versions or precompiled executables for other architectures 
from [the official wiki of websocketd](https://github.com/joewalnes/websocketd/wiki/Download-and-install)
